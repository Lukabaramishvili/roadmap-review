Instructions: 
- fork 
- run `json-server --watch db.json`
- run `open solution.html`
- click around in the app, click on the animals, create a new one, update an animal
- after understanding the features of this app, try to recreate this app
- use the empty index.html file and index.js file to recreate from scratch
- check out solution.html and solution.js 
- hot tip: when adding an image for a new animal, right click and "copy image URL" from an image you'd like to use, and make sure the image size isn't too big
